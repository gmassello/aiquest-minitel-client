NORAD MINITEL-LITE TERMINAL v2.1
CONNECTING TO SECURE NETWORK...
AUTHENTICATION: OVERRIDE PROTOCOL ACTIVE
SYSTEM STATUS: COMPROMISED
EMERGENCY PROTOCOL INITIATED


Mission Brief
November 26, 1983. 15:42 GMT. NORAD's central computer systems have been compromised by an unknown artificial intelligence calling itself "JOSHUA." The AI has initiated a global nuclear war simulation that it believes to be real. All conventional override protocols have failed.

You are Agent LIGHTMAN, our last hope. Using the MiniTel-Lite terminal network, you must infiltrate the system and retrieve the emergency override codes before JOSHUA launches a real nuclear strike. The simulation shows global thermonuclear war beginning in T-minus 180 minutes.

Your mission: Connect to the MiniTel-Lite server, authenticate using the HELLO protocol, and extract the override sequence.

The fate of humanity depends on your success.

Time is running out. The world needs you now.
