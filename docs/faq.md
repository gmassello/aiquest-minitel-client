Frequently Asked Questions
Q: What's the goal?
A: This is a simulation / challenge designed for you to have fun and learn while using our development tools.

Q: How can I win the challenge?
A: You need to develop a tool that can connect to the server and send the correct authentication code through the provided form. Use your application to establish a TCP connection to IP_ADDRESS_AND_PORT_PROVIDED_OVER_SLACK and follow the protocol specifications to retrieve the override code.

Q: Who wins?
A: To be eligible for winning, you must meet all criteria:
* Submit the form with the correct secret code and a public repository link (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
* Achieve minimum 80% test coverage with automated tests
* Follow clean architecture principles and coding standards
* Include comprehensive error handling and logging
* Provide detailed documentation and code comments
* Pass code review by NORAD senior engineers
* Be among the first 3 participants meeting all quality criteria

Q: Who determines code quality and best practices?
A: Our panel of senior NORAD engineers (from our engineering team) will perform comprehensive code reviews, assessing architecture quality, test coverage, security practices, and maintainability standards.

Q: Where should I post my source code?
A: Your source code should be published in a public repository (GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket). Since this is a simulation exercise, please use anonymized personal information and never commit secret keys or sensitive credentials. Your repository must include clear README instructions for running tests and verifying code quality.

Q: What is my development budget?
A: You have up to $10 in credits available for code generation. Use this budget wisely and focus on purposeful development rather than experimental coding. You will receive an API key for this specific challenge.
